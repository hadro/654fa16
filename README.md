#  Information Technologies at Pratt SI

Welcome to 654! 

I'm using Github this semester as an experimental tool for distributing files and as a method of helping folks get more acquinted with code editors and open tools, etc. 

See below for basic headline info, but see the [`syllabus`](syllabus) section for the formal full course information documents, and the [`assignments`](assignments) folder for the descriptions of materials you will turn in.

See you in class!
