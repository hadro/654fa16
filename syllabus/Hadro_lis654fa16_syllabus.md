## Course Description:

This course introduces the fundamental concepts of computing and networking, with an emphasis on the role these technologies play in creating, manipulating, storing, and accessing information. Topics essential to the work done by information professionals will be highlighted: web technologies, database concepts, markup languages, data management, and design and accessibility. Students will conduct frequent hands-on activities to acquire skills that are immediately applicable to working with information technologies. The course will explore recent trends in technology within information organizations, preparing students for their roles as information professionals and providing the foundation for future technology-related coursework.

- **Objectives**

This course will explore the expression and support of library and information science principles through practical technologies.

Specifically, this course will:

- Develop a general understanding of Internet and web development principles
- Introduce fundamental concepts and applications of content storage and management systems
- Understand contemporary issues and trends in the development and changes of information technologies
- Examine the direct and indirect relationships between core library and information science principles and the predominant technologies used by library patrons and students.

- **Student Learning Objectives**

Among other things, students will:

+ gain a familiarity with prevailing technology issues, and the skill set for keeping current as those issues evolve.
+ be able to assess web technologies, and edit web documents as necessary in many professional positions.
+ become familiar with vocabulary used to discuss the technological underpinnings of libraries and archives, in order to be conversant with peers and colleagues in a wide variety of roles.
+ be able to identify and articulate connections between library science principles learned in this and other introductory classes and the tools in widespread use by patrons and students.

**LMS Program students:** please see attached page for New York State Learning Standards applicable to this course and information on observation conducted within the scope of this class.

**Important Note** : This is not a skills class. Although we will study and use specific technologies, such as HTML, CSS and other related tools, the focus of the course will be on the role of these technologies in the information professions, not necessarily on the skills themselves.

- **Prerequisites**

This is a graduate-level technology course. Although there are no academic prerequisites, prior toenrolling in SILS, students must be proficient in the skills listed in &quot;The SILS Student Technology Expectations&quot; adopted and distributed to students since July 2006 (see attached at end of syllabus). The course will move along under this assumption and SILS faculty will provide no remedial assistance during or outside of class.

- **Technology Tutoring**

Pratt SILS offers technology tutorial assistance to students taking 654 and other courses. Assistance with development components of assignments should be directed to the tutor. The tutoring service is managed through the SILS office and is available 20 hours a week either by walk-in or appointment. For information on hours of operation, contactthe SILS office or see above.

## Required Texts

There are no texts that are required purchases for this course. All required readings will be available online or on the LMS site listed above.

**Blank Technology Canvas Pitch Presentation (10%)**

The ability to pitch ideas effectively to a group and to integrate feedback are essential skills in this profession. As a precursor to the Blank Technology Canvas Proposal Report, students will prepare a five-minute in-class presentation, covering a proposed vision for the space, their inspirations, and other relevant elements supporting their proposal. Students will have the option of using PowerPoint, Prezi (free education version), or other tools (upon approval) to create the presentation. A separate assignment sheet will be distributed in class.

**Blank Technology Canvas Proposal Site (25%)**

For this exercise, students will draft a proposal to develop a large information service space for a user demographic of their choice. Students will work under the assumption that a parent organization has set aside space dedicated for this purpose, and have already secured funding to award to a meritorious proposal. Basic IT and broadband infrastructure are a given, but further potential uses for the space will stem from the student&#39;s vision. The proposal should take into account the specific needs of a particular target user demographic, and will also require that students consider potential partner organizations as well as areas of potential expansion. Likewise, students will include with the proposal examples of sites – real or conceptual – that served as inspiration.  Students will receive feedback on their proposed ideas in class before embarking on the final proposal report. A separate assignment sheet detailing specifications and requirements will be distributed in class.

# Attendance/Participation

Attendance at all class meetings is required. A student who must be absent from a class meeting still has certain responsibilities:

- To inform the instructor in advance, or if advance notice is not possible, as soon after the absence as possible to arrange for delivery to the instructor of any assignment due at the class meeting.
- To obtain notes, handouts, etc. from a classmate (in anticipation of this need, each student is advised to exchange telephone numbers with one or two others in the class).
- Points are deducted for: unexcused absences, coming late to class, or leaving class early.
- Active participation includes, but is not limited to the following:
  - Being involved in class discussions.
  - Asking relevant questions, debating, or challenging points.
  - Suggesting new ways of looking at things.
  - Volunteering to take notes, organizing activities and helping other students.

## Written Work:

Students should always keep copies of all assignments that are turned in. In the case of a piece of written work becoming lost, regardless of fault, it is the responsibility of the student to provide a second copy.

## Communication

The best way to contact me is by email ( [josh.hadro+654fa16@gmail.com](mailto:josh.hadro+654fa16@gmail.com)). I typically respond within 24 hours and usually sooner. Should that change, you will be notified in advance. For questions pertaining to upcoming assignments, make sure to contact me well in advance of the deadline such that you can receive the necessary help prior to the deadline.

## Student Agreement

Attendance at this class signifies that the student has agreed to abide by and adhere to the policies and regulations specified above. It is understood that the instructor may adapt or change this syllabus and the assignments contained within it according to circumstances that may arise during the course of the class.

# Appendix: On Fair Use

Fair use is an extremely important facet of the information industry, and is an essential component of the law to understand and be able to clearly communicate to patrons, researchers, students, and anyone else who might benefit from fair use.

## 17 U.S. Code § 107 - Limitations on exclusive rights: Fair use

[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107)

Notwithstanding the provisions of sections [106](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106) and [106A](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106A), the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include—

(1) **the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;**
(2) **the nature of the copyrighted work;**
(3) **the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and**
(4) **the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.**

The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors.

---

The following are the best and most succinct informal criteria for fair use I&#39;ve heard:

**1.** _Are you using the material to illustrate a specific point that you&#39;re trying to make?_
**2.** _Are you only using so much as is necessary to make that point?_
**3.** _Is it clear to the audience what that point is?_
