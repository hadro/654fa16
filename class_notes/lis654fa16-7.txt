Five laws of library science:
    1 Books are for use
    2 Every reader his [or her] book
    3 Every book its readers
    4 Save the time of the reader
    5 The library is a growing organism


You are not the user.

De Facto design, design momentum:
    Stapler in drawer vs on the desk where people could use it.
    Tall tables or bar seats without hooks
    Push or pull doors missing indicators
    QWERTY keyboard



Usability testing
User testing <-- don't use


User Research:
    http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2012/03/academic-libraries/users-dont-know-what-libraries-are-talking-about-studies-find/#_
    
    
    
    Surveys
		 + Broad reach, lots of response
		 - Can be junk data
    Focus Groups
			+ Depth! passion! Human connection 
			- Time consuming, costly, Group think, conflicting data/opinions
    Interviews
	     + Controlled setting, in-depth
			- Super inefficient 
    Web Analytics
	     + Raw data, lots of data, easy, cheap
			- Not as good as you think they are, care required, measure only what you put there
    Field studies
	    + Observation, requires training, 
       - time consuming
